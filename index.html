                  <h3>Residential Tenancy Law</h3>
                  <p class="short-description">Residential Tenancy Law encompasses regulations governing tenant and
                     landlord rights, obligations, and dispute resolutions in rental properties.</p>
                  <div class="full-description">
                     <h2>Rent Payment and Increases</h2>
                     <h3>Non-Payment of Rent</h3>
                     <p>When a tenant fails to pay rent, you as the landlord have <strong>rights to act</strong>. It's best to act promptly by issuing the official notices to the tenant. The RTA mandates specific waiting periods after these notices, so delaying the issuance will extend the overall process longer than necessary.</p>

                     <h3>Vacancy Decontrol</h3>
                     <p>When renting to a new tenant, you can charge any rent the tenant agrees to. It's important to set a proper rent initially, as future rent increases are generally <strong>limited</strong>. While there are exceptions to the annual rent increase guideline, typically you're restricted to this limit. For 2025, the rent increase guideline will be <u>2.5%</u>.</p>

                     <h3>Discounts</h3>
                     <p>If you anticipate a <strong>rising rental market</strong>, using <strong>discounts</strong> can help you set a higher lawful rent than the tenant's actual payment. However, the rules for calculating lawful rent based on these discounts can be complex. The RTA allows for various discounts, and we can help you <strong>maximize</strong> your ability to raise rents in the future.</p>

                     <h3>Rent Increases</h3>
                     <p>You can <strong>raise rents</strong> within certain limits and opportunities, but you must wait at least <u>12 months</u> between increases. Additionally, you need to provide your tenant with a <strong>Notice of Rent Increase ("NORI")</strong>—currently the N1 form—at least <u>90 days</u> before the increase. If you don't have the N1 form, you can call our receptionist, and we'll fax it to you for free.</p>

                     <p>The N1 form includes boxes to justify the rent increase, with the most common reason being that the increase is within the <strong>guideline</strong>, which is set each August for the following year. For 2025, the guideline is <u>2.5%</u>.</p>
                     
                     <p> As a landlord, you can sometimes justify a rent increase above the guideline by either applying for an above-guideline rent increase or by agreeing with the tenant to provide additional services or renovations.</p>
                     
                     <h3>Rent Increases by Applications</h3>
                     <p>If you perform <strong>major repairs</strong> or <strong>renovations</strong> in your building, you can apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board for an order to raise rents by more than the guideline. Only work done within a specific period can be claimed, so if you complete significant work and the market supports higher rents, investigate an application promptly. We can advise you on the potential rent increase.</p> 
                     
                     <p>You can also apply for a rent increase beyond the guideline due to <strong>extraordinary tax increases</strong>.</p> 
                     
                     <p>Owners of <strong>mobile home parks</strong> facing substantial costs for water works or septic systems may be eligible for special rules allowing extra rent increases of <u>10%, 20%, or 30%</u> in one year to cover these expenses.</p>

                     <h3>Rent Increases by Agreement</h3>
                     <p>If you perform <strong>repairs</strong> or <strong>renovations</strong> in a rental unit, you can agree with the tenant on a rent increase above the guideline. This increase is limited to <u>3%</u> of the rent. You must use a specific form that outlines the tenant's right to cancel the agreement by written notice within <u>5 days</u> of the agreement date. If you need the form, <strong>call our receptionist</strong>, and we will fax it to you.</p>


                     <h2>Legal Rights and Responsibilities</h2>

                     <h3>Maintenance Disputes</h3>
                     <p>As a landlord, you must keep rental units in <strong>good repair</strong>, except for damage caused by the current tenant. If you neglect your repair obligations, a tenant can apply for a <strong>reduction in rent</strong>. Various defenses may be available depending on the circumstances. Under the RTA, tenants can also seek orders to <strong>prohibit rent increases</strong> if there are serious maintenance issues.</p>

                     <h3>Personal Use</h3>
                     <p>Landlords sometimes wish to move into a rental unit or allow a family member to do so. There are various <strong>restrictions</strong> on this right. As a landlord, you must start the process with a <strong>notice of termination</strong> using a Board-approved form.</p> 
                     
                     <p>If a tenant does not move out after receiving the notice, you must apply to the Board for an <strong>eviction order</strong>. Key issues include whether your intention to move in is <strong>honest</strong> and whether the eviction is retaliatory. Tenants may argue it is unfair to be forced out of "their home." The Board has the discretion to <u>delay</u> or <u>refuse</u> the eviction.</p>

                     <h2>Tax-Related Matters</h2>

                     <h3>Tax Driven Rent Reductions</h3>
                     <p>When municipal property taxes decrease by more than <u>2.49%</u> from one year to the next, an automatic rent reduction occurs on December 31 of the second year. The next reductions will take place on December 31, 2024.</p> <p>The RTA reduces the lawful rent by <strong>20%</strong> of the tax decrease for buildings with 7 or more units. For a 10% tax decrease, the rent reduction would be <u>2%</u> (10% times 20%). For buildings with 6 or fewer units, the rent is reduced by <strong>15%</strong> of the tax decrease.</p> 
                     
                     <p>These rent reductions apply to all residential units in any rental complex with a tax decrease exceeding 2.49%, regardless of building size. Municipalities must send rent reduction notices to tenants in buildings of 7 units or more. Since these notices indicate the reduction as a percentage, you should also provide a notice specifying the dollar amount of the change.</p> 
                     
                     <p>Tenants moving in after December 31, 2024, are not eligible for any rent reduction effective on that date.</p>

                     <h3>Applications about Tax Driven Rent Reductions</h3>
                     <p>If the 2024 property taxes are less than <u>20%</u> (or <u>15%</u> for buildings with 6 or fewer units) of a building’s annual rents, you as the landlord can apply to the Tribunal to reduce the rent reduction, if it applies to your building. The application should be made as soon as possible and must be submitted by <strong>March 31, 2025</strong> for the December 31, 2024 rent reduction.</p>

                     <h3>Applications about Tax Increases</h3>
                     <p>Instead of a tax decrease, a reassessment may result in an increase in property taxes, or the City of Ottawa may impose a tax hike. If you experience an unusual increase in property taxes (i.e., more than a regulated amount, typically <u>1% to 3%</u>), you can apply to raise your rents by more than the guideline.</p>

                     <h3>Our Services</h3>
                     <p>We would be happy to advise you about your rights and obligations as a landlord, and about the steps you can take to improve the financial return from the property you own or manage.</p>

                  <p class="short-description">Property Tax & Assessment Law covers regulations and deadlines concerning
                     property tax applications, assessments, tenant notifications, and strategic tax planning in

                     <p>Through 1997, 1998 and 1999 the government of Ontario has made many reforms to the property tax
                        system. This section deals mainly with the law as it applies at January 2007 and for the future.

                        <p>Billing commercial and industrial tenants for tax recoveries has become a very complicated
                           operation. Issues many owners deal with include:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Different tax rates for different assessment portions (for example, office tower,
                              shopping centre and residual commercial).</li>
                           <li>Determining the building's taxes if fully occupied.</li>
                           <li>Setting a standard tax rate in the building or separate standard tax rates for different
                              uses in a mixed use building (for example, ground floor retail versus office, which is not
                              the same as the difference between office tower and commercial).</li>
                           <li>The allocation provisions in all the leases.</li>
                           <li>Tenants' tax caps.</li>
                           <li>Changes faced by tenants because of the elimination of separate business occupancy tax
                              rates.</li>
                           <li>Landlord's shortfalls.</li>

                     <h2>Budgeting and Planning</h2>
                     <p>For the 2021, 2022, and 2023 property taxes, new assessments were based on <u>2016 market values</u>. However, for most property owners, the final 2021, 2022, and 2023 taxes did not fully reflect the new assessments because increases were <strong>capped</strong>, and decreases were <strong>clawed back</strong> to compensate for revenue lost due to these caps.</p> 
                     
                     <p>For the 2024 property taxes, new assessments are based on <u>2021 market values</u>. From 2025 onwards, assessments will be based on market values as of January 1 of the previous year. Taxes on many properties continue to be capped or clawed back, so taxes may still change from year to year even if assessments remain constant.</p> 
                     
                     <p>The taxation system includes different tax rates for various property classes, leading to significant issues for <strong>property tax planning</strong> that can potentially reduce taxes. Many planning issues require long lead times and are best addressed early in new developments or re-developments. <strong>Getting advice early</strong> can be highly beneficial.</p>
