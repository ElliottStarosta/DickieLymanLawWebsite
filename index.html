                  <h3>Residential Tenancy Law</h3>
                  <p class="short-description">Residential Tenancy Law encompasses regulations governing tenant and
                     landlord rights, obligations, and dispute resolutions in rental properties.</p>
                  <div class="full-description">
                     <p>We act for landlords in all multi-residential legal issues.</p>
                     <h2>Rent Payment and Increases</h2>
                     <h3>Non-Payment of Rent</h3>
                     <p>When a tenant does not pay their rent, you as the landlord have rights against the tenant. You are best to act quickly, giving the official notices to the tenant. The RTA requires certain waiting periods after the official notices. Therefore, you will have to wait longer than you may want if you give the tenant time before giving them the official notices.</p>

                     <h3>Vacancy Decontrol</h3>
                     <p>When you rent to a new tenant you are allowed to charge whatever rent the tenant is willing to pay. You should make sure that you get a proper rent, because once you have set the first rent you are generally limited in the rent increases you can take.</p>

                     <p>There are special circumstances, which are explained below, in which you can raise the rent more than the annual rent increase <strong>guideline</strong>. However, you are generally limited to the guideline. For rent increases in 2017 the guideline is 1.5%. For rent increases that take effect in the year 2018 the guideline is 1.8%.</p>

                     <h3>Discounts</h3>
                     <p>If you are renting and expect the rental market to rise, you may want to use <strong>discounts</strong> to set a higher lawful rent than the effective rent that the tenant really has to pay. Depending on the discounts you use, there are complicated rules to determine the lawful rent on which you can base future rent increases. The RTA expands the types of discounts landlords can use.  We can assist you to maximize your ability to raise your rents in the future.</p>

                     <h3>Rent Increases</h3>
                     <p>When you want to, you can raise rents based on a number of limits and opportunities. You must leave at least 12 months between rent increases. You also have to give your tenant an up-to-date Notice of Rent Increase ("NORI") at least 90 days before the intended rent increase date. The current NORI is called a form N1. If you do not have the N1 form, <strong>you can phone our receptionist, and we will fax it to you at no charge.</strong>
                     </p>
                     <!-- This info might need to be updated for 2024 / 2025 -->
                     <p>The N1 form has boxes to tick to indicate what justifies the rent increase. The most common way to justify a rent increase is that the increase is less than or equal to the <strong>guideline</strong>. The guideline is announced in August each year for the next year. For rent increases that take effect in 2018, the guidline is 1.8%.</p>

                     <p>As a landlord you can also sometimes justify a rent increase of more than the guideline. You can do this by two main ways: first, by applying for an above guideline rent increase; and second, by agreeing with the tenant to provide additional services or renovations.</p>
                     
                     <h3>Rent Increases by Applications</h3>

                     <p>If you do major repairs or renovations in your building you can apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board for an order allowing you to raise the rents by more than the guideline. You can only claim work done within a certain period of time; therefore, if you do significant work, and the market will allow you to raise a number of your rents by more than guideline, you should investigate an application promptly. We can advise you how much you would be able to obtain above the guideline.</p> 
                     
                     <p>You can also apply for an order allowing you to raise the rent beyond the guideline if you have had extraordinary increases in taxes.</p> 
                     
                     <p>Owners of mobile home parks sometimes have to spend a great deal of money on water works or septic systems.  There are special rules that may allow extra rent increases of 10 or 20 or 30% in one year to allow the cost of such work to be recovered.</p>

                     <h3>Rent Increases by Agreement</h3>

                     <p>If you do repairs or renovations in a rental unit you can make an agreement with the tenant for a rent increase above guideline. The extra rent increase is limited to 3% of the rent. There is a form that you must use that sets out the tenant's right to cancel the agreement by written notice within 5 days of the date of the agreement. If you want the form, <strong>you can phone our receptionist, and we will fax it to you.</strong></p>


                     <h2>Legal Rights and Responsibilities</h2>

                     <h3>Maintenance Disputes</h3>
                     
                     <p>As a landlord, you are required to keep rental units in good repair, except for damage caused by the current tenant. If you fail to meet your repair obligations a tenant can apply for a reduction in the rent. There are various defenses which can be available depending on all the facts. Under the RTA, tenants can now seek orders prohibiting rent increases where there are serious maintenance issues.</p>

                     <h3>Personal Use</h3>

                     <p>Landlords sometimes want to move into a rental unit, or allow a family member to move into the rental unit. There are various restrictions on an owner's right to do that. As a landlord you must begin the process with a notice of termination on a form approved by the Board.</p> 
                     
                     <p>If a tenant does not move out in response to your notice of termination, you have to apply to the Board for an eviction order. The main issues would be whether your intention to move in is honest and true, and whether the eviction is in retaliation for something the tenant has done. Sometimes the tenant will claim that it is not fair that they should be forced to move out of "their home". The Board has a discretion to delay or refuse to grant the eviction.</p>

                     <h2>Tax-Related Matters</h2>

                     <h3>Tax Driven Rent Reductions</h3>

                     <p>When the municipal property taxes decrease by more than 2.49% from one year to the next year there is an automatic rent reduction at December 31 of the second year.  The next automatic rent reductions will take place on December 31, 2017.</p> 
                     
                     <p>The RTA reduces the lawful rent by 20% of the tax decrease for buildings with 7 or more units. For a building with a 10% tax decrease the automatic rent reduction would be 2% (10% times 20%). For buildings with 6 or fewer units, the rent is reduced by 15% of the tax decrease.</p> 
                     
                     <p>The rent reductions apply to every residential rental unit in every rental complex with a tax decrease of more than 2.49%, no matter what the size of the building.</p>

                     <p>Municipalities are required to send rent reduction notices to tenants of buildings of 7 units or more. Since those notices state the rent reduction as a percentage, you as a landlord should send your own notice to tell tenants what the change in the rent is in dollars.</p>

                     <p>Tenants who move in after December 31, 2017, will not qualify for any rent reduction that takes place at that date.</p>

                     <h3>Applications about Tax Driven Rent Reductions</h3>

                     <p>If the 2016 property taxes are less than 20% (or 15% where the building has 6 or fewer units) of a building’s annual rents, then you as the landlord can apply to the Tribunal to reduce the rent reduction, if such a reduction applies to your building. The application should be made as soon as possible, and must be made by March 31, 2018 for the December 31, 2017 rent reduction.</p>

                     <h3>Applications about Tax Increases</h3>

                     <p>Instead of a tax decrease, the reassessment may bring an increase in property taxes, or the City of Ottawa may impose an increase in property taxes. If you experience an unusual increase in property taxes (ie. an increase of more than a regulated amount, usually 1 to 3%), you can apply to raise your rents more than the guideline.</p>

                        <p>Billing commercial and industrial tenants for tax recoveries has become a very complicated operation. Issues many owners deal with include:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Different tax rates for different assessment portions (for example, office tower, shopping centre and residual commercial).</li>
                           <li>Determining the building's taxes if fully occupied.</li>
                           <li>Setting a standard tax rate in the building or separate standard tax rates for different uses in a mixed use building (for example, ground floor retail versus office, which is not the same as the difference between office tower and commercial).</li>
                           <li>The allocation provisions in all the leases.</li>
                           <li>Tenants' tax caps.</li>
                           <li>Changes faced by tenants because of the elimination of separate business occupancy tax rates.</li>

                     <h2>Budgeting and Planning</h2>

                     <p>For the 1998, 1999 and 2000 property taxes, new assessments were put in place based on 1996 market values. However for most owners, the final 1998, 1999 and 2000 taxes did not fully reflect the new assessments because increases were capped, and decreases were clawed back to make up the revenue lost by the caps.</p> 
                     
                     <p>For the 2001 and 2002 property taxes, new assessments were issued based on 1999 market values. For the 2003 property taxes, new assessments were issued based on 2001 market values. From 2004 to the end of 2005, the assessments were based on market values at June 30 of the previous year. The new valuation date used to determine property values for '06, '07, and '08 taxes, is January 1, 2005. However, the taxes on many properties are still capped or clawed back. Therefore, taxes will change from year to year even if assessments stay constant.</p> 
                     
                     <p>The taxation system includes different tax rates on different classes of properties. For this and other reasons there are significant new issues for property tax planning which can reduce taxes. Many of the planning issues have long lead times, and are best implemented early in new developments or early in re-developments. the sooner you get advice the better off you will be.</p>
