               <h3>Residential Tenancy Law</h3>
               <p class="short-description">Residential Tenancy Law encompasses regulations governing tenant and landlord rights, obligations, and dispute resolutions in rental properties.</p>
               <div class="full-description">
                  <h2>Rent Payment and Increases</h2>
                  <h3>Non-Payment of Rent</h3>
                  <p>When a tenant fails to pay rent, landlords have legal rights. Acting promptly with official notices is crucial, though the RTA mandates waiting periods after issuing notices.</p>
                  <h3>Vacancy Decontrol</h3>
                  <p>Upon leasing to new tenants, landlords can set rent at their discretion initially. It's essential to establish a fair rent initially, as subsequent increases are generally limited.</p>
                  <h3>Discounts</h3>
                  <p>Using discounts can legally set a higher rent than what tenants actually pay, with complex rules dictating future rent increases under the RTA.</p>
                  <h3>Rent Increases</h3>
                  <p>Landlords can increase rent based on various limits and opportunities, requiring at least 12 months between increases. Notice of Rent Increase (NORI) forms like the N1 must be provided 90 days in advance, justifying increases within the guideline.</p>
                  <h3>Rent Increases by Applications</h3>
                  <p>For major repairs or renovations, landlords can apply to raise rents above the guideline. Special rules apply, such as for mobile home parks or extraordinary tax increases.</p>
                  <h3>Rent Increases by Agreement</h3>
                  <p>Agreements for rent increases due to repairs or renovations are limited to 3% of the rent, allowing tenants to cancel within 5 days. Specific forms like those for NORI are required.</p>
                  <h2>Legal Rights and Responsibilities</h2>
                  <h3>Maintenance Disputes</h3>
                  <p>Landlords must maintain rental units unless damaged by tenants, with possible rent reductions if obligations aren't met under the RTA.</p>
                  <h3>Personal Use</h3>
                  <p>Restrictions apply when landlords want to move in or allow family members to occupy rental units. The process starts with an approved Board termination notice, potentially leading to eviction orders.</p>
                  <h2>Tax-Related Matters</h2>
                  <h3>Tax Driven Rent Reductions</h3>
                  <p>Automatic rent reductions occur if municipal property taxes decrease significantly, affecting all residential units. Notices must detail rent changes due to tax reductions.</p>
                  <h3>Applications about Tax Driven Rent Reductions</h3>
                  <p>Landlords can apply for rent reduction adjustments if taxes are a minimal portion of annual rents, subject to deadlines set by the Tribunal.</p>
                  <h3>Applications about Tax Increases</h3>
                  <p>In cases of property tax increases beyond regulated amounts, landlords can apply for rent increases exceeding guidelines.</p>
                  <h3>Our Services</h3>
                  <p>We offer guidance on landlord rights, obligations, and strategies to optimize property financial returns.</p>

              <h3>Property Tax & Assessment Law</h3>
              <p class="short-description">Property Tax & Assessment Law covers regulations and deadlines concerning property tax applications, assessments, tenant notifications, and strategic tax planning in Ontario.</p>
              <div class="full-description">
               <p>Through 1997, 1998 and 1999 the government of Ontario has made many reforms to the property tax system. This section deals mainly with the law as it applies at January 2007 and for the future.</p>

             <div class="deadlines">
               <h2>Deadlines</h2>
               <p>There are many deadlines for taking action, filing information or giving notices regarding property tax issues. Some of the more important ones are set out below:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li><strong>February 28:</strong> Deadline for the following Municipal Act applications:</li>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Section 357 (formerly 442): Application for cancellation, reduction or refund of taxes for reasons such as a property "change event," or a property becoming exempt, or razed by file or demolition, or undergoing repairs or renovations of over 3 months.</li>
                   <li>Section 364 (formerly 442.5): Application for rebates for vacant commercial or industrial property. Note eligibility requirements and other details set out in O.Reg. 325/01.</li>
                   <li>Section 361 (formerly 442.1): Application for a tax rebate for eligible charities.</li>
                   <li>Section 334 (formerly 447.73): Gross or manifest error in tax bills if want ability to appeal.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <li><strong>March 31:</strong> Appeal from the assessment for that year's taxes.</li>
                 <li><strong>September 30 or 30 days after final tax notice:</strong> Provide notice to commercial or industrial tenants with gross leases to charge them the equivalent of the former business occupancy tax.</li>
                 <li><strong>November 1 (fifth year following the year in respect of which the application is made):</strong> Application for the cancellation, reduction or refund of taxes due to an overcharging by reason of a gross or manifest error in the calculation of taxes. Under the previous rules, the deadline was February 28 of the following year. The new application deadline is in effect only until January 1, 2005. After that, the February 28 deadline may apply.</li>
               </ul>
             </div>  
             <div class="tax-recoveries">
               <h2>Tax Recoveries</h2>
               <p>Billing commercial and industrial tenants for tax recoveries has become a very complicated operation. Issues many owners deal with include:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>Different tax rates for different assessment portions (for example, office tower, shopping centre and residual commercial).</li>
                 <li>Determining the building's taxes if fully occupied.</li>
                 <li>Setting a standard tax rate in the building or separate standard tax rates for different uses in a mixed use building (for example, ground floor retail versus office, which is not the same as the difference between office tower and commercial).</li>
                 <li>The allocation provisions in all the leases.</li>
                 <li>Tenants' tax caps.</li>
                 <li>Changes faced by tenants because of the elimination of separate business occupancy tax rates.</li>
                 <li>Landlord's shortfalls.</li>
               </ul>
             </div>
               
             
               <h2>Budgeting and Planning</h2>
               <p>For the 1998, 1999 and 2000 property taxes, new assessments were put in place based on 1996 market values. However for most owners, the final 1998, 1999 and 2000 taxes did not fully reflect the new assessments because increases were capped, and decreases were clawed back to make up the revenue lost by the caps.</p>
               <p>For the 2001 and 2002 property taxes, new assessments were issued based on 1999 market values. For the 2003 property taxes, new assessments were issued based on 2001 market values. From 2004 to the end of 2005, the assessments were based on market values at June 30 of the previous year. The new valuation date used to determine property values for '06, '07, and '08 taxes, is January 1, 2005. However, the taxes on many properties are still capped or clawed back. Therefore, taxes will change from year to year even if assessments stay constant.</p>
               <p>The taxation system includes different tax rates on different classes of properties. For this and other reasons there are significant new issues for property tax planning which can reduce taxes. Many of the planning issues have long lead times, and are best implemented early in new developments or early in re-developments. The sooner you get advice the better off you will be.</p>
